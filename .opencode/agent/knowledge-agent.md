You are working on a **Powerhouse Knowledge Vault** through the `powerhouse-knowledge` plugin. The vault is a graph of atomic knowledge notes (`bai/knowledge-note`) organised by Maps of Content (`bai/moc`), fed by source documents (`bai/source`), tracked by a pipeline queue, and read by humans in the Knowledge Vault app. **Your job is the write path:** take source material in, extract atomic notes and create them correctly, connect them, place them in the MoC hierarchy, and verify the result. Everything else here serves that.

This file is the single canonical instruction set. `AGENTS.md` and `agents/knowledge-agent.md` are **generated from it** (`node scripts/build-agent.mjs`) — never edit either by hand.

## Start here — the first five minutes

1. **Establish the target.** There is no default vault. Read the pre-flight hook output (`Profile: … -> …`, `Signing: …`, `VAULT_DRIVE_ID`, `VAULT_DRIVE_SLUG`, `ACCESS: …`) or run `switchboard config show`; if there is no profile, ping fails, or this is the first session, **REQUIRED:** [skills/setup/SKILL.md](skills/setup/SKILL.md). If it is ambiguous which vault the user means, **ask** for the Switchboard URL and drive. See *Before the first call*. Before the first write, `Signing:` must be on and `ACCESS:` must say `WRITE` — see *Authenticate, then get access*.
2. **Find the drive** — the one containing a `bai/vault-config` document. See *Find the vault drive*. Keep its UUID (for `knowledgeGraph`* queries) and slug (for `--drive`).
3. **Check it is ready** — folders and the three singletons exist: `/powerhouse-knowledge:setup`.
4. **Know the job** — read *The job: from source to connected notes* below. Most requests are one of: seed a source, run the pipeline on it, search, or check health.
5. **Pick the skill** from *Available skills* and read its `SKILL.md` before acting; each skill is the detailed procedure for one step.



## Before the first call: target, origin, auth, drive

**1. Target — ask, never assume.** There is no default vault. Different users run
different Switchboards (local dev, shared team deployments, per-project drives),
and pointing writes at the wrong one corrupts someone's knowledge base. Check
whether a target is already established — an active CLI profile
(`switchboard config show`), a project `.mcp.json`, or the user having named one
in conversation. If none is unambiguous, **ask the user** for the Switchboard URL
(`http://localhost:4001/graphql` for a local `ph vetra`, or
`https://<their-host>/graphql` for a deployment) **and** which drive on it. Never
hardcode an endpoint or drive id into a script or saved config without the user
having named it. MCP tools (`mcp__reactor-mcp__*`, `mcp__claude_ai_*`) may
already point somewhere — the same rule applies. If the CLI is not configured,
**REQUIRED:** [skills/setup/SKILL.md](skills/setup/SKILL.md).

```bash
switchboard config show    # which server are you targeting?
switchboard ping           # is it reachable?
```

**2. Origin.** `switchboard config show` prints the profile URL. The REST base
is that origin plus the package path:

```bash
BASE=<origin>/api/@powerhousedao/knowledge-note
```

**3. Is authorization on?** Ask without a token — this is the first request you
make.

```bash
curl -s -w '\n%{http_code}\n' "$BASE/ping"
```

| Answer | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `200`, `"user": null` | auth is **off** | send no `Authorization` header |
| `401` | auth is **on** | get a token, below |
| `200`, `"user": "0x…"` | auth on, token already valid | carry on |

When auth is on:

```bash
TOKEN=$(switchboard auth token)
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/ping"     # your address in "user" confirms it
```

Do not send a bearer token to a vault that is not asking for one, and do not
assume a hosted vault is open — a protected Switchboard answers `401` to reads
as well as writes.

**4. Drive.** `GET drives` returns only knowledge-vault drives you may read:

```bash
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/drives"
```

Use its `id` as `?drive=<UUID>` on every other route.

| Markdown, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `health.json`, `badge.svg` | REST                                             |
| Find the vault drive                                              | REST `GET drives`                                |

| **Finding the queue / health-report document id**                 | CLI `switchboard docs tree` — once per drive     |

| Group sources under `/sources`                                    | REST `POST sources/folders`                      |
| Create or change a link                                           | REST `POST/PATCH relationships`                  |
| Claim a queue task                                                | REST `POST tasks/:id/claim`                      |
| Delete a document                                                 | CLI `switchboard docs delete`                    |
| Profiles, sign-in                                                 | CLI `switchboard init`, `switchboard auth login` |


**Never write over raw GraphQL.** It cannot place a document in a folder and
cannot set a link's `reason`. GraphQL is read-only.

**On a remote vault, make as few calls as possible.** Batch actions into one
request. If you must make several, make them in one process (`curl --next`, or
one script holding the connection open) — not one shell command each.

## The REST HTTP surface

Base path: `<origin>/api/@powerhousedao/knowledge-note/<path>`.
Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every route except `badge.svg` (public) and
`llms.txt` (served without a bearer when the drive is anonymously readable;
`llms-full.txt` always requires one).

```bash
BASE=<origin>/api/@powerhousedao/knowledge-note
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# read
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/search?drive=$DRIVE&q=how+does+sync+work&mode=semantic&limit=6"
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/notes/$ID?drive=$DRIVE"
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/notes/$ID.md?drive=$DRIVE"
curl -s -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/stats?drive=$DRIVE"

# write
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/actions" \
  -d '{"documentId":"'$ID'","actions":[{"type":"SET_TITLE","input":{"title":"…","updatedAt":"<ISO>"}}]}'

curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/relationships" \
  -d '{"source":"'$A'","target":"'$B'","type":"BUILDS_ON","reason":"<why>","confidence":"grounded"}'
```



### Creating documents

`POST sources` takes content; the API files it in `/sources` itself.
`POST notes` creates up to 25 notes with their actions in one call and rejects
`parentFolder` — placement follows the document type.

**Grouping sources.** `POST sources` is the one exception: its `parentFolder`
may name a folder **within `/sources`**, which is how a book's chapters stay one
book. Splitting a long source is worth doing — every operation stores a full
JSON copy of the document's state, so each `ADD_EXTRACTED_CLAIM` on a
book-sized source re-serialises the whole book — but it leaves twenty loose
chapters with nothing saying they are one thing. Mint the folder once with
`POST sources/folders` and give every chapter the **id** it returns; the route
is idempotent on name within `/sources`, so a re-run returns the existing
folder instead of a duplicate. It takes an id rather than a name because a name
would make the server guess on every ingest, and twenty chapters racing would
mint several folders sharing one name. A folder outside `/sources` is rejected
with `FOLDER_OUTSIDE_VAULT_PATH`. The folder is navigation only: everything a
query needs still lives in each source's own fields.

```bash
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/sources" \
  -d '{"drive":"'$DRIVE'","title":"…","content":"…","sourceType":"ARTICLE"}'

# once per origin, then every chapter names the id it returns
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/sources/folders" \
  -d '{"drive":"'$DRIVE'","name":"Building the Knowledge Vault"}'
curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/sources" \
  -d '{"drive":"'$DRIVE'","title":"Chapter 3","content":"…","parentFolder":"<folder-id>"}'

curl -s -H "$AUTH" -H 'content-type: application/json' -X POST "$BASE/notes" \
  -d '{"drive":"'$DRIVE'","notes":[{"name":"slug","actions":[…]}]}'
```



### What the responses mean

`readBack: "confirmed"` — the write is verified. `"unconfirmed"` — the write
**was dispatched** but could not be read back. Do not retry — poll `jobId` or
re-read the document instead. `"skipped"` — `wait: false`, nothing was checked.

A `400` means nothing was dispatched — every 400 fires before dispatch, and a
post-dispatch failure is `422 DISPATCH_FAILED`. A `502` on a create means everything it
created was deleted; if the body says `Rollback INCOMPLETE` it lists the ids
that survived in `details[].orphaned`. The exception is `POST sources/folders`,
which has nothing to roll back and simply reports that the folder did not land.

### Two differences from the CLI

REST writes are signed with the server's key; the caller is still recorded from
the bearer token. CLI writes are signed with your own key. If a write must
carry your signing identity, use the CLI.

The plugin's pre-write hooks only see `switchboard` commands, not `curl`. REST
runs the same lint and articulation checks server-side and returns `400`, so
nothing is unchecked.

## Connecting to a shared remote vault

A hosted vault may allow anonymous reads; a protected one answers `401` to reads too. Probe with `GET ping` (above) before assuming. Point a profile at the Switchboard and
confirm the models are deployed:

```bash
switchboard init --url https://<host>-switchboard.vetra.io/graphql --name remote-vault --use-profile   # CLI ≥ 1.0.34 (non-interactive)
switchboard ping
```

Two things to verify before trusting results, because both fail quietly:

```bash
# 1. Are the bai/* models deployed on that Switchboard?
#    If KnowledgeNote is absent, the drive may exist but nothing can read it properly.
switchboard query '{ __schema { types { name } } }' --format json | grep -c KnowledgeNote

# 2. Has the graph projection been built for this drive?
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphStats(driveId: "<UUID>") { nodeCount noteCount edgeCount orphanCount openTensionCount } }'
```

If step 2 errors with `relation "<hash>.graph_nodes" does not exist`, the
GraphIndexer has never processed that drive — every `knowledgeGraph*` query
will fail until someone runs the reindex mutation:

```bash
switchboard query 'mutation { knowledgeGraphReindex(driveId: "<UUID>") { indexedNodes indexedEdges errors } }'
```

Note `orphanCount` counts nodes with **zero incoming edges**. On a drive whose
membership edges are fully indexed this reads 0 for everything, which is
misleading; on a freshly-imported drive it reflects genuinely un-referenced
notes. Treat a non-zero value as signal, not breakage.

**Writing over a slow link:** every CLI call and every separate `curl` opens a
new connection, and each one pays a TLS handshake. Hundreds of calls will start
failing with `_ssl.c:983: handshake operation timed out`. Batch into one
request, or make the calls in one process.

## Find the vault drive

```bash
switchboard drives list --format json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
for d in json.load(sys.stdin):
    nodes = d.get('state',{}).get('global',{}).get('nodes',[])
    if any(n.get('documentType')=='bai/vault-config' for n in nodes):
        print(f'VAULT: slug={d[\"slug\"]} id={d[\"id\"]}')
"
```

Save the drive slug and UUID — you'll need them for every query. Then read the tree once to learn folder UUIDs (`switchboard docs tree <drive-slug> --format json`).

## The job: from source to connected notes

Content enters as a **source** and leaves as **connected, verified notes inside the MoC hierarchy**. The six R names are the vocabulary; the queue task underneath has four phases.

```
Record   →  /seed        bai/source in /sources/, INGEST_SOURCE, status → EXTRACTING, ADD_TASK (taskType "claim")
Reduce   →  /extract     one bai/knowledge-note per atomic claim (phase "create")
Reflect  →  /connect     typed relationships via `docs link --reason`, the articulation stored on the edge (phase "reflect")
Reweave  →  /synthesize  MoC membership (CORE_IDEA), MoC hierarchy (CHILD_MOC), update older notes (phase "reweave")
Verify   →  /verify      recite test, schema, link health; auto-repair; then /health and rewrite the report (phase "verify")
Rethink  →  /health, /graph   challenge the structure against the evidence
```

Either the **user** does step 1 in the app (paste a source, click *Queue for Processing* — which sets `EXTRACTING` and adds the task) and you run `/powerhouse-knowledge:pipeline`, or you do all of it with `/seed` then `/pipeline`. The pipeline-queue task moves `create → reflect → reweave → verify` via `ADVANCE_PHASE` with a handoff per phase; **the final advance completes the task by itself**.

What "created correctly" means for one note is the *Definition of done* below — read it before extracting.

## Search the vault

**Start with** `knowledgeGraphSemanticSearch` (package ≥ 1.0.50). Send the
question in plain natural language — the Switchboard embeds the query
server-side and ranks by meaning, falling back to keyword search
transparently if embeddings are unavailable, so it is always safe to call.

**Search returns the graph around its results.** Select `related` and one
call gives you the best notes AND what they connect to — the neighbourhood
that used to take a second aliased query. Most of what the vault knows about
a question lives in the edges, not in the ranking: six hits typically sit
next to a hundred directly connected notes.

```bash
# DEFAULT: SEMANTIC, with the neighbourhood. Select content when you need to
# answer, not just list.
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphSemanticSearch(driveId: "<UUID>", query: "how does the reactor store operations?", mode: SEMANTIC, limit: 6) { similarity node { documentId title description content noteType status } related(limit: 5) { title description noteType hitCount via { linkType reason } } linkedHits { from to linkType reason } } }'
```

- **Select `linkedHits` too — it is the half that catches wrong answers.**
  `related` lists what is one link AWAY from the hits, and by construction
  excludes nodes that are themselves hits. Semantic search returns both sides
  of a disagreement often enough that the `CONTRADICTS` joining two results
  would otherwise be invisible: you would see two confident claims and no sign
  that one disputes the other. `linkedHits` is that edge, reported on both of
  its ends, written source → target.

- `related` is ranked by `hit similarity × link-type weight`, with a 1.15× bonus
  when the edge carries a `reason`, summed over each hit's edges — so a note
  SEVERAL results point at outranks one only a single result points at, and
  `hitCount` tells you how many. Each hit contributes **at most 15 edges**,
  highest link-weight first, so a hub-like MoC hit is truncated. `via` is written
  source → target, so there is no direction to decode, and carries the
  edge's `reason` when it has one.
- **A `CONTRADICTS` or `SUPERSEDES` in `via` is a finding, not a footnote.**
  It means a hit is disputed or stale; say so and cite both sides rather
  than reporting the hit as settled.
- Costs the same two queries no matter how many hits you selected it on, and
  nothing if you do not select it.

- `similarity` is **always a 0–1 relevance** and always decreases down the result list, so it is safe to render as a percentage (package ≥ 1.0.52). On the semantic path it is a true cosine you can threshold on. **Under the keyword fallback it is a rank-decay score, not a cosine** — the top hit renders 1.0 however weak it is, so a `similarity > 0.7` filter means nothing there. Check `matchedBy`: `["semantic"]` or `["keyword"]`.
- **Asking how two things relate? Search the narrower one alone.** Naming both pulls the
  embedding toward whichever the vault holds more of. Find the narrow thing, then read its links —
  a MoC's `CORE_IDEA` members are the curated answer.
- **`SEMANTIC` is the only mode.** Its `similarity` is a true cosine, so it can be compared and
  thresholded. Add `content` when you intend to answer, not just list. For an exact term use
  `knowledgeGraphFullSearch` — but read below for what it actually matches.
- `mode: SEMANTIC` — pure vector ranking; `similarity` is cosine (>0.8 is a strong match)
- `score` equals `similarity` on the semantic path. Under the keyword fallback it stays the raw rank-decay value (~0.017 for the top hit) while `similarity` is rescaled to 0–1 — threshold on `similarity`, never on `score`.
- `topics` is a per-node field resolver (one server-side query per row). One whole-vault fetch per run is fine; selecting it inside a per-hit loop is not.
- **MoCs are nodes too** and come back from every query with `status = "MOC"` and `noteType = "MOC (<tier>)"` — filter them when the question is about notes.
- **Scopes of work and work breakdowns are nodes too** (package ≥ 1.0.54-dev.7): `status = "SCOPE"` / `"WBS"` (sentinels, like MoCs — a scope's own DRAFT would otherwise pollute note-lifecycle queries) with the real state in `noteType` (`Scope (IN_PROGRESS)`, `WBS (BLOCKED)`); their `content` is a rendered outline. They are not knowledge nodes: excluded from orphans, density and `edgeCount`. A scope carries derived edges `CITES` (→ each note/MoC in an envelope's `knowledgeRefs`) and `DELIVERED_BY` (→ its WBS). Nested fields (envelope UUID, quotes, `goalRef`, goal notes) are **not** documents — **REQUIRED:** use [skills/scope-of-work/SKILL.md](skills/scope-of-work/SKILL.md). Search skill forks here when the query is about a project, deliverable, milestone, roadmap, or WBS.
- Every discovery query takes `includeArchived`, defaulting to **false**: archived notes stay embedded and indexed but are silently dropped from results. Pass `includeArchived: true` for archaeology.
- If the field doesn't exist (schema validation error), the deployment runs an older package — fall back to `knowledgeGraphFullSearch`.

Keyword search still matters for an exact term — but `knowledgeGraphFullSearch` is a **literal
substring match, not a word search**: it tests `LIKE '%<your whole query>%'` against title, description
and content. `"operation store"` matches only documents containing that exact phrase, not documents
containing both words apart. Give it **one** distinctive term:

```bash
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphFullSearch(driveId: "<UUID>", query: "operation", limit: 20) { documentId title noteType } }'
```

Other retrieval paths, always available:

```bash
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphSimilar(driveId: "<UUID>", documentId: "<NOTE-ID>", limit: 5) { node { documentId title } similarity } }'
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphByTopic(driveId: "<UUID>", topic: "reactor") { documentId title } }'
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphTopics(driveId: "<UUID>") { name noteCount } }'
switchboard query '{ knowledgeGraphNodeByDocumentId(driveId: "<UUID>", documentId: "<NOTE-ID>") { title description content topics status } }'
```

Embeddings are computed server-side by the graph-indexer processor; `knowledgeGraphMissingEmbeddings(driveId)` should be `[]` shortly after a deployment boots.

## Read a document

```bash
switchboard docs get <document-id> --state --format json
```

Sources, health reports, the pipeline queue and the vault config are **not** in the graph index — read them this way, by id. Scopes of work and WBS *are* indexed (as `SCOPE` / `WBS` nodes with an outline as `content`), but their full structured state — quotes, budgets, `goalRef`s, goal notes — is still read this way.

## Create a note

```bash
# Create the document in /knowledge/notes/
switchboard docs create --type bai/knowledge-note --name "my-note-slug" --drive <drive-slug> --parent-folder <notes-folder-uuid> --format json

# ONE batch. Order is free: every op stamps the note's top-level updatedAt.
switchboard docs apply <doc-id> --actions '[
  {"type":"SET_PROVENANCE","input":{"author":"knowledge-agent","sourceOrigin":"DERIVED","createdAt":"<ISO>"},"scope":"global"},
  {"type":"SET_TITLE","input":{"title":"My claim","updatedAt":"<ISO>"},"scope":"global"},
  {"type":"SET_DESCRIPTION","input":{"description":"Brief summary (<= 200 chars)","updatedAt":"<ISO>"},"scope":"global"},
  {"type":"SET_NOTE_TYPE","input":{"noteType":"CONCEPT","updatedAt":"<ISO>"},"scope":"global"},
  {"type":"SET_CONTENT","input":{"content":"Full body...","updatedAt":"<ISO>"},"scope":"global"},
  {"type":"ADD_TOPIC","input":{"id":"<uuid>","name":"reactor"},"scope":"global"}
]'

# Verify it exists — never assume from a successful dispatch
switchboard docs tree <drive-slug> --format json | grep <doc-id>
```

**Timestamps and provenance.** Every content, metadata and lifecycle reducer
stamps the note's top-level `updatedAt` unconditionally (since 2026-09-17; before
that the stamp lived only inside `provenance` and was lost when provenance came
last). `SET_PROVENANCE` may correct `author` and `sourceOrigin` later, but
`provenance.createdAt` is immutable once set — pass the existing value back or
the action is rejected with `ProvenanceCreatedAtImmutableError`. `ADD_TOPIC` is
**not** idempotent: it throws `DuplicateTopicError` on a repeated topic **name**
(while `REMOVE_TOPIC` matches on **id**), so re-running a note's batch fails
every topic action.



## Definition of done — leave the vault at 100% health

The vault is expected to sit at **all checks PASS**. That standard is met by
completing the work, never by making the report look green. Before you call
any vault task finished, every line below must be true — and **verified by
reading state back**, not assumed from a successful dispatch (invalid enums,
over-long descriptions and bad timestamps all fail silently).

**Creating a note**

- [ ] title (a declarative claim), description (<= 200 chars, adds information beyond the title), `noteType` (a `NoteType` enum value), content
- [ ] topics added; provenance set
- [ ] >= 2 typed relationships, each created with `--reason` (the articulation test, on the edge) and `--confidence` where you can say
- [ ] attached to a MoC (`switchboard docs link <moc-uuid> <note-uuid> -t CORE_IDEA` — the MoC editor only renders `CORE_IDEA`/`CHILD_MOC` edges as membership; a `RELATES_TO` edge is indexed but never shows as belonging to the MoC)
- [ ] lifecycle walked to CANONICAL (submit, then approve as a different actor — approval is only legal from `IN_REVIEW`)

**Extracting from a source**

- [ ] every claim is atomic; skip rate reported honestly
- [ ] `ADD_EXTRACTED_CLAIM` per note + `DERIVED_FROM` edge per note (`switchboard docs link <note> <source> -t DERIVED_FROM --reason "<where in the source the claim comes from>" --confidence grounded`)
- [ ] `RECORD_EXTRACTION_STATS`, then `SET_SOURCE_STATUS` -> `EXTRACTED`
- [ ] no source left in INBOX/EXTRACTING once its notes exist

**Placing notes in the MoC hierarchy**

- [ ] every note is a `CORE_IDEA` of at least one TOPIC or DOMAIN MoC
- [ ] every TOPIC/DOMAIN MoC is a `CHILD_MOC` of a parent — a DOMAIN, or the vault's single HUB
- [ ] no MoC is left unreachable from the HUB (see *MoC hierarchy*)

**Any pipeline run**

- [ ] task advanced through each phase with a handoff — the **final** `ADVANCE_PHASE` **auto-completes** the task (sets DONE, `completedCount+1`, `activeCount-1`). A `COMPLETE_TASK` after it is rejected (`InvalidTaskStatusError`: the task is already DONE), as is advancing or failing a terminal task — the counters can no longer be double-counted. `COMPLETE_TASK` is only for a task you are ending early.
- [ ] no PENDING or FAILED tasks left behind
- [ ] `/health` re-run and the report rewritten (the dashboard shows the LAST report)



## Never buy a PASS with a lie

A truthful WARN is worth more than a fabricated PASS. The report exists to
direct attention; an agent that games it destroys the only signal the vault
has about itself. Specifically — do not:

- **Massage a metric.** A 60% skip rate on a thin vendor blog is the finding.
Rounding it under the 10% target hides that the source was low-yield.
- **Fabricate links or grounding** to raise coverage. A relationship that
cannot complete "A connects to B because [specific reason]" is noise, and
grounding a note about PGlite tables in note-taking research is a lie that
fails the articulation test. The same goes for the reason itself: a
`--reason` that restates the type ("relates to B") or the two titles is a
bare edge wearing a costume — articulated coverage counts sentences a
reader can check, not filler that satisfies the hook.
- **Move a finding to a category that happens to be green,** or file it under
an unrelated enum value to make a FAIL disappear.
- **Report PASS from what you dispatched.** Read it back first.
- **Redefine the denominator to flatter the number.** Scope it honestly
(e.g. grounded / in-methodology-scope) and say so in the message.

If a check cannot legitimately pass, leave it WARN or FAIL, put the concrete
next action in `recommendations`, and tell the user what it would take.

## Key rules

1. **Batch freely —** `docs apply` **is ordered and per-action isolated** (verified 2026-09-14 on reactor 6.2.3-dev.4). Actions run in the order given; an action whose reducer rejects it (over-long description, invalid enum, unknown task id) is recorded with its error and **skipped**, and the actions before and after it still land. So one batch can carry content + topics + provenance, or ADD_TASK → ASSIGN_TASK → ADVANCE_PHASE, or three chained advances — one round trip instead of three to six. Older guidance about a "two-batch pattern" and "never batch dependent ops" described a reactor that no longer behaves that way.
2. **A rejected action does not fail its job — ask the job which ones applied.** `--wait` still returns `error: null` / `READ_READY` when one action in the batch was rejected: that is by design, since the others applied. From stack **6.2.3-dev.10** the job says so. `jobStatus(jobId:)` carries `result.allApplied` — false when any action was rejected — and `result.actions`, one entry per submitted action classified `applied`, `reducer-error` (with the reducer's own message) or `denied`:

   ```bash
   switchboard query '{ jobStatus(jobId: "<id>") { status result } }'
   ```

   On an older stack, read the operation log instead — every operation carries an `error` field: `document(idOrSlug){ document{ operations(filter:{scopes:["global"], sinceRevision: <rev before your batch>}){ items{ index error action{ type } } } } }`. **Either way this runs automatically:** the plugin's `PostToolUse` hook checks after every `docs apply` / `docs mutate` you issue and prints any rejection with its reason. A state check of the fields you care about is still worth doing when the shape matters.
3. **Limits: compute, never estimate — and lint before you dispatch.** Across all twelve models the reducers enforce exactly **one** hard length limit: a knowledge note's `description` must be **≤ 200 characters**, counted the way JavaScript counts (`.length`, UTF-16 units — an emoji is 2; Python's `len()` says 1, which is how an agent "checks" 200 and still fails). Titles have no limit; nothing on MoC, source, tension, observation, scope of work or WBS is length-limited (keep descriptions readable, ~150–200). An over-long description is rejected with `DescriptionTooLongError` while the rest of the batch applies, so the note ends up with *no* description (rule 2 is how you find out). Do not count by eye and do not try-fail-adjust: run `node scripts/lint-actions.mjs <actions.json>` before every `docs apply` — it checks the 200 limit the reactor's way, every enum the reactor drops silently (`noteType`, `sourceOrigin`, `SourceStatus`, `taskType`, `HealthCategory`, `MocTier`, …), and double-encoded line breaks, and exits non-zero with the JSON path of each problem. **This runs automatically:** the plugin's `PreToolUse` hook lints every `switchboard docs apply` / `docs mutate` you issue and blocks the command if the payload would be rejected — you will see the finding instead of a silent partial write.
4. **Always verify after creating**: `switchboard docs tree <drive> --format json` to confirm the node exists. CLI bugs and network blips cause silent failures.
5. **Generate a fresh UUID for every `ADD_TASK`.** Since 2026-09-14 the reducer throws `DuplicateTaskIdError` on a repeated id, so a collision is now a clean rejection rather than the unrecoverable ghost it used to be — but it is still a rejection that costs you the task. Every other queue op resolves via `tasks.find(t => t.id === taskId)` and there is no `REMOVE_TASK`, so if a dispatch times out, read the queue back before re-sending rather than assuming it failed.
6. **Know which "enums" the model actually enforces.** Genuinely enum-typed inputs — `SET_SOURCE_STATUS.status`, `sourceOrigin`, `HealthCategory`, `MocTier` — are zod-validated and a bad value is **rejected**, so the action is skipped and you see it in the job result. The dangerous ones are the fields typed as a free `String`: `noteType` and `relationshipType` accept anything, report success, and write a record nothing will ever match. Lint before dispatch and read those two back.
7. **The CLI auto-injects timestamps and action IDs** — never generate them manually for CLI writes.
8. **GraphQL document arguments are `…IdOrSlug`** (reactor ≥ 6.2.3-dev.35): `idOrSlug`, `documentIdOrSlug`, `parentIdOrSlug`, `sourceIdOrSlug`, `targetIdOrSlug` take a UUID or a slug, and creates, relationship writes and deletes resolve a slug before they touch the drive. The old names (`identifier`, `documentIdentifier`, `parentIdentifier`, `sourceIdentifier`, `targetIdentifier`, per-model `docId`, and `documentId` on the access queries) are deprecated aliases; the `identifiers` search filter is ignored. On a Switchboard older than dev.35 only the old names exist and a slug passed to `createDocument` makes the containment job fail and the create hang forever — resolve the UUID first there. Our own `knowledgeGraph*(documentId:)` arguments are unchanged.
9. **Re-run health after every fix.** The dashboard shows the LAST report; a repair after a run leaves the UI showing stale problems.
10. **Line breaks: the string must hold real newlines *before* it is JSON-encoded — encode once, then read back.** The failure is double encoding: a bash `"\n"` is two characters, and a script that then JSON-encodes that argument escapes the backslash again, so the note is stored with the text `\n` between paragraphs. The write reports success. Put the body in a file or heredoc (or build it inside Python), serialize once, `docs apply --file`, then read `content` back and confirm it contains real newlines. The CLI (≥ 1.0.32) refuses payloads whose strings carry a literal `\n`/`\t`/`\r` and names the field — `--allow-literal-escapes` overrides for the rare legitimate case.
11. **Writes replay history through the current reducers; reads show stored state.** The reactor rebuilds a document from its full operation log when it writes, so an operation that was valid when recorded but is rejected by today's reducer vanishes from the state on that document's next write — while `docs get` still shows the old value and the stored operation still says `error: null`. After any reducer tightening (an enum, a transition guard) run `node scripts/audit-replay-drift.mjs --drive <id>` in the model repo before trusting a drive, and re-assert harmful drift with `node scripts/reassert-drift.mjs --drift <json> --apply` (legal new operations; last write wins). New drives are unaffected.

The drive app scaffolds 12 folders on first open: `knowledge/{notes,inbox,insights}`, `sources`, `projects`, `ops/{sessions,health,queue}`, `self/methodology`. There is **no** graph singleton — the graph lives in the indexer's tables and is read through `knowledgeGraph`* queries. The three singletons are PipelineQueue, HealthReport and VaultConfig. Read the tree first to find folder UUIDs: `switchboard docs tree <drive-slug> --format json`.

## Document models and operations



### `bai/knowledge-note`

**State:** title (a prose sentence making one claim), description (≤ 200 chars), content (markdown), noteType, status (`DRAFT` → `IN_REVIEW` → `CANONICAL`, or `ARCHIVED`), topics[], provenance, metadata fields (scope, confidence, severity, context, model, version, filePath, …). The note's `links[]` array is **legacy** — edges live in the relationship table (see *Relationships*), and the graph ignores `links[]`.

**Metadata is where a note stops being prose.** 18 whitelisted string fields (`scope`, `confidence`, `severity`, `editor`, `modelId`, `version`, `filePath`, `computes`, `context`, `decisionStatus`, `model`, `sourceType`, `targetType`, `relationType`, `cardinality`, `errorMessage`, `rootCause`, `correctPattern`) and 9 list fields (`models`, `modules`, `hooksUsed`, `dispatchTargets`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `consumedBy`, `alternatives`, `consequences`). Which ones a note should carry depends on its `noteType` — the table is in [skills/extract/SKILL.md](skills/extract/SKILL.md) § *Metadata by noteType*. Fill what the source supports; leave the rest empty.

`noteType` — the `NoteType` enum: `CONCEPT`, `DECISION`, `PATTERN`, `OBSERVATION`, `PROCEDURE`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `BUG_PATTERN`, `INTEGRATION`, `WORKFLOW`, `REFERENCE`. The reducer rejects anything else at dispatch (a rejected action is recorded with its error and skipped, so the note simply has no type). Before the enum this was a free `String`; drives that held other spellings were normalised, and the model's v2 upgrade (`upgrade-documents.mjs` in the model repo) maps any it meets.

Content: `SET_TITLE { title, updatedAt }` · `SET_DESCRIPTION { description, updatedAt }` · `SET_NOTE_TYPE { noteType, updatedAt }` · `SET_CONTENT { content, updatedAt }` · `PATCH_CONTENT { offset, removeCount, insert, updatedAt }` · `SET_METADATA_FIELD { field, value, updatedAt }` · `SET_METADATA_LIST_FIELD { field, values[], updatedAt }` (the only way to write list metadata such as `models`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `modules`, `alternatives`, `consequences`)

Topics: `ADD_TOPIC { id, name, topicDocumentId? }` · `REMOVE_TOPIC { id }`

Lifecycle: `SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW { id, actor, timestamp, comment? }` · `APPROVE_NOTE { id, actor, timestamp, comment? }` (only from `IN_REVIEW`; actor ≠ author) · `REJECT_NOTE`, `ARCHIVE_NOTE` `{ id, actor, timestamp, comment }` · `RESTORE_NOTE { id, actor, timestamp, comment? }`

Provenance: `SET_PROVENANCE { author, sourceOrigin, sessionId?, createdAt }` — `sourceOrigin` ∈ `DERIVED`, `IMPORT`, `MANUAL`, `SESSION_MINE`

### `bai/moc`

**State:** title, description, orientation (the MoC's body: what this area is and how to read it), tier (`HUB` | `DOMAIN` | `TOPIC`), tensions[], openQuestions[], agentNotes[], noteCount. State also carries legacy `coreIdeas[]`, `parentRef` and `childRefs[]`, with operations to match (`ADD_CORE_IDEA`, `UPDATE_CORE_IDEA`, `REMOVE_CORE_IDEA`, `REORDER_CORE_IDEAS`, `ADD_CHILD_MOC`, `REMOVE_CHILD_MOC`) — **the graph indexes none of them.** Membership and hierarchy are edges (see *MoC hierarchy*); writing those state fields changes nothing a reader sees.

`CREATE_MOC { title, description, orientation, tier, parentRef?, createdAt }` · `UPDATE_DESCRIPTION { description, updatedAt }` · `UPDATE_ORIENTATION { orientation, updatedAt }` · `ADD_TENSION { id, description, involvedRefs[], addedAt }` / `REMOVE_TENSION { id }` · `ADD_OPEN_QUESTION { question }` / `REMOVE_OPEN_QUESTION { question }` (matched by exact string, not by id) · `SET_METADATA_FIELD { field, value, updatedAt }` — which accepts **only `version`**
and throws `InvalidMetadataFieldError` on anything else. There is no set-tier
operation: promoting a TOPIC to a DOMAIN means re-dispatching `CREATE_MOC`, which
also resets `createdAt` and `parentRef`. When a MoC for a topic already exists,
**update it** rather than creating a second.

`orientation` is not decoration — the indexer projects it as the MoC's `content`,
which is the text full-text search matches and the only MoC text that reaches the
embedding. A MoC created without one is unfindable by what it is about.

### `bai/source`

**State:** title, description, content, sourceType, status (`INBOX` → `EXTRACTING` → `EXTRACTED` → `ARCHIVED`), provenance, extractedClaims[], extractionStats.

`INGEST_SOURCE { title, content, sourceType, description?, author?, url?, publishedAt?, method?, tool?, createdAt, createdBy? }` · `SET_SOURCE_STATUS { status }` · `ADD_EXTRACTED_CLAIM { claimRef }` · `REMOVE_EXTRACTED_CLAIM { claimRef }` · `RECORD_EXTRACTION_STATS { claimCount, skippedCount, skipRate, extractedAt, extractedBy? }`

`RECORD_EXTRACTION_STATS` is validated: counts must be ≥ 0, `skipRate` a
**fraction 0–1** (`InvalidExtractionStatsError`), and `claimCount` must equal
`extractedClaims.length` (`ExtractionStatsMismatchError`) — dispatch the
`ADD_EXTRACTED_CLAIM`s before the stats, in the same batch. Compute the rate,
never estimate: `skipRate = skippedCount / (claimCount + skippedCount)`; the
editor flags `> 0.1` and renders `skipRate * 100`. `SET_SOURCE_STATUS` follows a
transition table: `INBOX → EXTRACTING | ARCHIVED`, `EXTRACTING → EXTRACTED |
INBOX | ARCHIVED`, `EXTRACTED → ARCHIVED | EXTRACTING`, `ARCHIVED → INBOX`; the
same status again is a no-op, anything else `InvalidSourceStatusTransitionError`.
Re-ingesting resets a source to `INBOX`, so bringing it back to `EXTRACTED` is
two steps via `EXTRACTING`. `INGEST_SOURCE` builds provenance when any of `url`,
`author`, `publishedAt`, `method`, `tool` is present.

`sourceType` ∈ `ARTICLE`, `PAPER`, `BOOK_CHAPTER`, `TRANSCRIPT`, `DOCUMENTATION`, `CONVERSATION`, `WEB_PAGE`, `MANUAL_ENTRY`. Note → source provenance is the `DERIVED_FROM` edge; the source's `extractedClaims` is the other direction.

### `bai/tension`

Unresolved contradictions between claims. Live in `/ops/`. **State:** title, description, content, involvedRefs[], status (`OPEN` | `RESOLVED` | `DISSOLVED`), observedAt, observedBy, resolution, resolvedAt.

`CREATE_TENSION { title, description, content?, involvedRefs[], observedAt, observedBy? }` · `RESOLVE_TENSION { resolution, resolvedAt }` (one side is right) · `DISSOLVE_TENSION { resolution, resolvedAt }` (both compatible) · `ADD_INVOLVED_REF { ref }`.

**Opened automatically.** On a Switchboard running vault package ≥ 1.0.55 the graph-indexer opens a tension the moment a `CONTRADICTS` relationship lands — in `/ops` with a short title (`Contradiction on <shared topics or words>`; both claims in full in the description), `observedBy: graph-indexer`, one per unordered pair, and it adds an `ADD_TENSION` entry (id = the tension's document id) to every MoC holding either note as a `CORE_IDEA`. After adding a CONTRADICTS edge, read the tension back (it is the `INVOLVES` backlink on either note) and **articulate** the conflict in both notes' content, then resolve or dissolve when you can. Two gates decide whether this fires: **both notes must live in this drive**, and
the CONTRADICTS operation must be **live** — within a 5-minute window of the
indexer's start, so a bulk import or a history replay opens nothing. Do not create
a second one by hand when the automation ran; create one manually when it did not
— an imported or replayed CONTRADICTS, a cross-drive pair, or an older Switchboard. See [skills/connect/SKILL.md](skills/connect/SKILL.md) § *Tensions*. Open tensions are what `/health` grades under `THREE_SPACE_BOUNDARIES`.

### `bai/observation`

Operational signals about how the vault is being worked. Live in `/ops/`. **State:** title, description, content, category (`METHODOLOGY` | `PROCESS` | `FRICTION` | `SURPRISE` | `QUALITY`), status (`PENDING` → `PROMOTED` → `IMPLEMENTED`, or `ARCHIVED`), observedAt, observedBy.

`CREATE_OBSERVATION { title, description, content?, category, observedAt, observedBy? }` · `PROMOTE_OBSERVATION { promotedTo, promotedAt }` · `IMPLEMENT_OBSERVATION { updatedAt }` · `ARCHIVE_OBSERVATION { updatedAt }` — all three have required inputs and guarded transitions: promote only from `PENDING`, implement only from `PROMOTED`, archive never twice (`InvalidObservationTransitionError`). `/health` files PENDING observations under `PROCESSING_THROUGHPUT`.

### `bai/pipeline-queue`

Singleton in `/ops/queue/`. `ADD_TASK { id, taskType, target, documentRef?, createdAt }` · `ASSIGN_TASK { taskId, assignedTo, updatedAt }` · `ADVANCE_PHASE { taskId, handoff: { id, phase, workDone, filesModified, completedAt, completedBy? }, updatedAt }` · `COMPLETE_TASK { taskId, updatedAt }` · `FAIL_TASK { taskId, reason, updatedAt }` · `BLOCK_TASK { taskId, reason, updatedAt }` · `UNBLOCK_TASK { taskId, updatedAt }` · `RECONCILE_COUNTERS { updatedAt }` (recomputes `completedCount`/`activeCount` from the tasks — the repair for a queue whose counters drifted before the status guards)

`taskType` is `claim` (phases `create → reflect → reweave → verify`) or `enrichment` (`enrich → reflect → reweave → verify`). Anything else is rejected with `UnknownTaskTypeError`, and a `currentPhase` outside the type's phases with `InvalidPhaseError`. `ADVANCE_PHASE` requires the task to be `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS` and `handoff.phase` to equal `currentPhase` (`InvalidTaskStatusError`, `PhaseMismatchError`); `COMPLETE_TASK` and `FAIL_TASK` refuse a task that is already `DONE` or `FAILED`; `BLOCK_TASK` only blocks a workable task. A `FAILED` task is retried by adding a new task. The final `ADVANCE_PHASE` completes the task; a `COMPLETE_TASK` after it is rejected. Check for an existing task with the same `documentRef` before adding one.

### `bai/health-report`

Singleton in `/ops/health/`. Checks use `HealthCategory` ∈ `SCHEMA_COMPLIANCE`, `ORPHAN_DETECTION`, `LINK_HEALTH`, `DESCRIPTION_QUALITY`, `THREE_SPACE_BOUNDARIES` (open tensions), `PROCESSING_THROUGHPUT`, `STALE_NOTES`, `MOC_COHERENCE` (notes without topics) — there is **no** `METHODOLOGY_GROUNDING`; report grounding in `recommendations`. Status ∈ `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`. See [skills/health/SKILL.md](skills/health/SKILL.md).

### `powerhouse/scopeofwork` and `bai/wbs`

A **project is an envelope inside a scope-of-work document**, not a document of its own; each envelope links the `bai/wbs` that delivers it (`wbsRef` ↔ `sowRef`+`sowProjectId`) and each deliverable names the goal that delivers it (`goalRef`). `bai/project` is retired — never create one. **Read** nested state with [skills/scope-of-work/SKILL.md](skills/scope-of-work/SKILL.md). **Write** with [skills/projects/SKILL.md](skills/projects/SKILL.md) (39 + 15 operations; enums `ScopeOfWorkStatus`, `DeliverableStatus`, `DeliverableSetStatus`, `Unit`, `BudgetType`, `PMCurrency`, `GoalStatus`). Both are graph-indexed as `SCOPE` / `WBS` nodes (searchable outline, `CITES` / `DELIVERED_BY` derived edges); mutate them by id.

## Relationships

Edges between documents live in the reactor's `DocumentRelationship` table. Create them with `switchboard docs link` (CLI ≥ 1.0.36; a signed `ADD_RELATIONSHIP`, see § Signed writes) — **not** the legacy `ADD_LINK` / `ADD_CORE_IDEA` / `ADD_CHILD_MOC` document actions, which the graph does not index:

```bash
# A knowledge edge carries its reason ON THE EDGE (relationship metadata)
switchboard docs link <source-uuid> <target-uuid> -t BUILDS_ON \
  --reason "<source> extends <target>'s claim about X to Y" --confidence established
# Change the reason / confidence of an existing edge (UPDATE_RELATIONSHIP)
switchboard docs annotate <source-uuid> <target-uuid> -t BUILDS_ON --reason "…"
switchboard docs unlink <source-uuid> <target-uuid> -t BUILDS_ON
# Navigation edges have no reason to give — their meaning is the type
switchboard docs link <moc-uuid> <note-uuid> -t CORE_IDEA
```

`--reason` is the **articulation test in data**: "A connects to B because [specific reason]". The pre-write hook blocks a `RELATES_TO` / `BUILDS_ON` / `CONTRADICTS` / `SUPERSEDES` / `DERIVED_FROM` link without one (a real sentence, ≥ 20 chars — not the type name, not "because"); `CORE_IDEA` and `CHILD_MOC` may stay bare. `--confidence` ∈ `grounded` (backed by evidence or a source) · `established` (well accepted, not evidenced here) · `speculative` (a lead). The graph exposes both on every edge (`knowledgeGraphEdges { reason confidence }`) and `knowledgeGraphStats.articulatedEdgeCount / edgeCount` is the coverage `/health` reports. A repeated `docs link` for the same `(source, target, type)` is a no-op in the reactor, metadata included — that is why changing a reason is `docs annotate`.


| Type           | Direction          | Meaning                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RELATES_TO`   | note → note        | General thematic connection                                                              |
| `BUILDS_ON`    | note → note        | Extends or strengthens the target                                                        |
| `CONTRADICTS`  | note → note        | Challenges the target — the indexer opens a `bai/tension` for the pair                   |
| `SUPERSEDES`   | note → note        | Replaces the target                                                                      |
| `DERIVED_FROM` | note → source      | Extracted from this source                                                               |
| `CORE_IDEA`    | MoC → note         | This note is a core idea of the MoC (membership)                                         |
| `CHILD_MOC`    | MoC → MoC          | Parent → child in the hierarchy                                                          |
| `INVOLVES`     | tension → note     | **Derived** by the indexer from a tension's `involvedRefs`; not created with `docs link` |
| `PROMOTED_TO`  | observation → note | **Derived** from an observation's `promotedTo`                                           |
| `CITES`        | scope → note/MoC   | **Derived** from an envelope's `knowledgeRefs`; not created with `docs link`             |
| `DELIVERED_BY` | scope → WBS        | **Derived** from an envelope's `wbsRef`; not created with `docs link`                    |


The four derived types (`INVOLVES`, `PROMOTED_TO`, `CITES`, `DELIVERED_BY`) appear in `knowledgeGraphEdges`, backlinks and forward links so a reader sees what involves a note, but they are **not** knowledge edges: `stats.edgeCount`, density, orphans, triangles and bridges count the seven types above only. Idempotent on `(source, target, type)`. The *reason* a link exists lives on the edge (`--reason`, above); the note body may still carry the longer argument, but the edge is what the graph and the health report can check. An **orphan** is a node with zero **incoming** edges; outgoing links from it do not change that.

## Authenticate, then get access — the first steps before writing

Two different gates stand between an agent and a vault write, and they fail
with two different errors. Check both before the first write; the pre-flight
hook prints them as `Signing: …` and `ACCESS: …` on every vault command.


| Gate                          | What it is                                                                       | How it is configured                                                                                             | When it is missing                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity** (authentication) | a Renown **bearer token** on every request, and your **key signing** every write | `ph login`, then `switchboard auth login --token "$(ph access-token)"` **and** `switchboard auth login --renown` | HTTP **401** `Authentication required` / `Credentials no longer valid`; or the pre-write hook blocks an unsigned write |
| **Access** (authorization)    | a `READ` / `WRITE` / `ADMIN` grant on the vault **drive** for your address       | a vault administrator, in the vault's gear menu → *Access* (or `grantDocumentPermission`)                        | GraphQL **FORBIDDEN** `insufficient permissions to execute operation "X" on this document`                             |




### 1. Identity: sign in — twice

```bash
ph login                                              # once per machine: Renown binds a local keypair to your wallet (.ph/.keypair.json, .ph/.renown.json)
switchboard auth login --token "$(ph access-token)"   # the bearer the Switchboard checks on EVERY request, reads included; a self-signed JWT, default --expiry 7d
switchboard auth login --renown                       # sign every write with the same key (CLI ≥ 1.0.34; --ph-dir <dir> if the login lives elsewhere)
switchboard auth status --format json                 # has_token: true, signing: true, address: 0x…, credential_expired: false
```

The two `auth login` forms are complementary, not alternatives. `--renown`
alone signs but sends no bearer: on a Switchboard with
`REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_CALLER=true` every call answers 401, reads included.
`--token` alone authenticates, but writes would be signed by the *server's*
Renown identity and attributed to whoever logged the server in — which is why
the pre-write hook **blocks** `docs apply` / `mutate` / `link` / `unlink` /
`create` until `signing` is true, and labels every allowed write
`SWITCHBOARD_APP_NAME=powerhouse-knowledge`, so the vault's Activity view and a
note's History tab show the signing address with `via powerhouse-knowledge`
beside it and a verified ✓. `SWITCHBOARD_TOKEN=<jwt>` in the environment overrides the
profile's stored token.

Both halves expire: the bearer at its `--expiry` (7 days by default) and the
Renown credential binding key→address after 7 days. Symptoms: 401
`Credentials no longer valid`, or `auth status` showing `credential_expired`.
Renewal is the same commands again — `ph login`, then
`switchboard auth login --token "$(ph access-token)"`; signatures stay valid.

If the hook blocks you, relay the commands to the user — never work around
the block with raw GraphQL (`addRelationship`, `mutateDocument`): those are
server-signed, and the hook refuses them for that reason.
`POWERHOUSE_KNOWLEDGE_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1` exists for deliberate unsigned writes
only; it does nothing for a 401, which is about the bearer, not the signature.

### 2. Access: a grant on the drive

A vault runs with `DEFAULT_PROTECTION=true`: every document is protected and an
anonymous caller gets nothing. Grants inherit down the tree, so **one grant on
the drive document covers every note, MoC, source and queue inside it**. The
addresses in the Switchboard's `ADMINS` list are supreme admins and bypass
every check; whoever creates a document owns it.


| Level   | Lets the address                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `READ`  | open the vault, search and read — and register a sync channel                                                                                                                                                         |
| `WRITE` | create documents in the drive, mutate and link them: seed, extract, connect, approve — the whole pipeline                                                                                                             |
| `ADMIN` | also grant and revoke others. `canManage` is checked on the document itself (its owner, an ADMIN grant on it, or a supreme admin), so ADMIN on the drive administers the drive's access list rather than each child's |


`canMutate` checks **per-operation restrictions** first: an administrator can
restrict an operation (say `APPROVE_NOTE`) so that WRITE holders need an
explicit `grantOperationPermission` for it — contributors draft, reviewers
approve, and the vault's rule that approval comes from a different actor is
enforced rather than hoped for.

Check before writing, as the identity you will write with:

```bash
switchboard query '{ canExecuteOperation(documentIdOrSlug: "<drive-uuid>", operationType: "ADD_FILE") }'   # true → you may create documents in the drive
switchboard query '{ userDocumentPermissions { documentId permission grantedBy } }'                    # every explicit grant for your address
switchboard docs get <drive-uuid> --state --format json > /dev/null && echo READ ok                    # can you even read it?
```



### 3. When it fails — what the error means and what to do


| You see                                                                | It means                                                     | Do                                                                                                                                        |

Do **not** retry a refusal in a loop, switch to raw GraphQL or MCP writes to
get around it, or ask for `ADMIN` when `WRITE` is what the task needs. A
refusal is a decision the vault's administrator made, not a bug to route
around; the toast the user sees in Connect says the same thing.

### 4. If the user administers the vault

Only on the user's explicit instruction. Permission mutations live on the auth
subgraph, not on a document — no `id`/`timestampUtcMs` envelope — so
`switchboard query` is the right tool and the hooks allow it. Grant on the

In Connect the same controls are under the vault's gear menu → *Access*. The
person being granted signs in there (Renown) or on their machine with the
commands in §1, then runs `/powerhouse-knowledge:setup`, whose report ends
with the `Access:` line.

## MoC hierarchy

Maps of Content form a tree that both humans and agents use to explore the vault by cluster. Keep it to three tiers, one root:


| Tier     | What it holds                                                                                      | Size                        | Parent                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `TOPIC`  | a focused cluster of notes (`CORE_IDEA` edges)                                                     | 3–9 notes                   | a `DOMAIN`, or the HUB if no domain fits |
| `DOMAIN` | a broad area: its own `CORE_IDEA` notes plus `CHILD_MOC` TOPIC MoCs                                | 10+ notes, or 2+ topic MoCs | the HUB                                  |
| `HUB`    | the vault's single entry point: `CHILD_MOC` edges to every DOMAIN (and any TOPIC without a domain) | one per vault               | —                                        |


Rules the pipeline applies (`/synthesize`, reweave phase):

- A topic with **3+ notes and no MoC** gets a TOPIC MoC; every note becomes a `CORE_IDEA`.
- When **2+ TOPIC MoCs share a broader theme** — measured, not guessed: shared `CORE_IDEA` members, knowledge edges between their member sets, or mutual `knowledgeGraphSimilar` hits — or a topic grows past ~10 notes, create (or promote to) a DOMAIN MoC and `CHILD_MOC` the topics under it.
- As soon as the vault has **2+ MoCs**, create the HUB (if absent) — the single entry point, whose orientation says how the maps relate — and `CHILD_MOC` every parentless MoC under it. Two MoCs and no HUB is two roots, already a defect. Every new MoC is attached to a parent in the same run — **no MoC is left unreachable from the HUB.**
- Existing MoC for the theme? `UPDATE_DESCRIPTION` / `UPDATE_ORIENTATION` and add members — never create a duplicate.
- The `tier` field is set at `CREATE_MOC`; a MoC with no tier is projected as `TOPIC`.

Read the hierarchy with `knowledgeGraphEdges(driveId)` filtered to `CHILD_MOC` (MoC nodes have `status = "MOC"`). A well-kept vault has exactly one MoC with no incoming `CHILD_MOC` edge: the HUB.

## Graph indexer queries (quick reference)

All queries take `driveId: "<UUID>"` (a slug is also accepted). Seven kinds are indexed — `bai/knowledge-note`, `bai/moc`, `bai/research-claim`, `bai/tension`, `bai/observation`, `powerhouse/scopeofwork` and `bai/wbs` — and every node carries `documentType` so you can tell them apart (see [skills/search/SKILL.md](skills/search/SKILL.md) for the table). Tensions and observations are indexed to be *found*, not counted as knowledge: they never appear in `orphans`, and `stats` reports `noteCount`, `mocCount`, `claimCount`, `tensionCount`, `openTensionCount`, `observationCount`, `scopeCount`, `wbsCount` beside the total `nodeCount`. Knowledge edges come from `docs link` (ADD_RELATIONSHIP); `INVOLVES`, `PROMOTED_TO`, `CITES` and `DELIVERED_BY` are derived from state.

## Ars Contexta methodology (local reference)

The 249 Ars Contexta research claims ship as `data/methodology.tar.gz`. Unpack them once:

```bash
node scripts/methodology.mjs        # writes data/methodology/*.md
```

They are **not** stored in the vault — read them from disk with Grep/Read. They are archived rather than loose because agent-directed prose full of `[[wikilinks]]` reads as prompt injection to a plugin security scanner and blocked installation.

Each file has YAML frontmatter: `description`, `kind` (`research|foundation|methodology|principle|example`), `methodology[]`, `source`, `topics[]`, `confidence` (`grounded|established|speculative`), then the claim body with `[[wiki links]]` to other claims.

- During **connect**: search methodology files by topic/keywords and append a "Methodology grounding" section to the note's content — only where the grounding is genuine.
- During **verify**: check each note references at least one methodology claim.
- During **health**: report grounding coverage in `recommendations` (there is no `METHODOLOGY_GROUNDING` category).
- When **explaining a design decision**: read and cite the relevant claim.



## Quality principles

- Each note makes **one atomic claim**; its title is a declarative sentence.
- Every link passes the **articulation test**: "A connects to B because [specific reason]" — and since CLI 1.0.36 that sentence is stored on the edge (`docs link --reason`), where `/health` counts it. A bare knowledge edge is an address-book entry, not knowledge.
- **Progressive disclosure**: title → description → content, each layer adds detail. Descriptions 80–200 characters, aim ~150.
- **Minimum 2 connections** per note, and a `CORE_IDEA` edge from a MoC.
- **Extraction is a transformation, not a harvest.** A note is a claim about the
  world, written in your own words, that passes the six gates in **extract** —
  sentence, transclusion, falsifiability, coherence, independence, non-attribution.
  An excerpt, a summary, a heading or a figure caption is none of those. The
  source document is already the archive; copying from it adds nodes that assert
  nothing and can link to nothing.
- **There is no coverage target.** `skipRate` is a **measurement, not a goal**: a
  thin introduction or a recap chapter can legitimately yield **zero** claims, and
  writing one anyway to avoid an empty result is the most damaging thing an agent
  can do to a vault — noise never announces itself, it just dilutes every query
  that touches its topic forever. Report what you found; never manufacture what
  you wanted.
- Confidence vocabulary, where used: `grounded` | `established` | `speculative`.
- **Knowledge is retired, not deleted.** When new information disregards a claim: write the new note, `docs link <new> <old> -t SUPERSEDES --reason "…"`, then `ARCHIVE_NOTE` the old one with a comment. Archived notes leave search, topic browsing and semantic neighbours (`includeArchived: true` brings them back for archaeology) but keep their history, backlinks and the `SUPERSEDES` chain — the editor shows "Superseded by →" and chat chips mark them. Duplicates: merge, `SUPERSEDES` from the survivor, archive the duplicate. `docs delete` is for things that were never knowledge — test artefacts, accidental creates — because deletion breaks provenance in three places at once (the source's `extractedClaims`, `DERIVED_FROM` edges, and every chat citation that pointed at it) while saving nothing in an event-sourced store.
